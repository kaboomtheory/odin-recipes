    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Classic Homemade Mac and Cheese made with bite-size pasta, cheddar cheese, and a simple creamy sauce all baked to perfection in the oven.  This recipe includes tips, tricks, and photos for making PERFECT baked mac and cheese.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Elbow macaroni: It’s my favorite for this recipe, but any other bite-sized pasta will work.</li>
        <li>Butter: salted or unsalted will work–just adjust the amount of salt you add, depending on the butter.</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Half and half</li>
        <li>Shredded Cheddar cheese: the higher quality aged-cheddar, the better!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven. Preheat to 325 degrees and lightly grease a square baking dish.</li>
        <li>Cook the macaroni. Slightly undercook your noodles (about 1 minute under al-dente). Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the roux.  Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Blend in the flour, salt, and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add milk and cheese.  Stir in milk and half and half, slowly, stirring constantly. Remove from heat. Add 1 cup shredded cheese to the sauce and stir just until melted. Add the cooked macaroni noodles and toss to coat them in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Pour into baking dish.  Pour half or the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle ½ cup cheese over the top. Pour remaining pasta over it and sprinkle with remaining cheese.</li>
    </ol>
