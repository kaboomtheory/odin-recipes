    <h1>Eggs Benedict</h1>
    <img src="eggsbenedict.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Eggs Benedict is my favorite breakfast menu item, and it's super easy to make from home! It starts with a toasted
        english muffin, topped with a slice or two of Canadian bacon, a poached egg, and smothered in traditional Eggs
        Benedict sauce, called hollandaise sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 English muffins</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 slices Canadian bacon</li>
        <li>Vinegar , just a splash</li>
        <li>or the Hollandaise sauce:</li>
        <li>4 Tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice , or lime juice</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <p>For the Hollandaise sauce:</p>
        <li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan. In a separate small bowl, beat the egg yolks. Mix in lemon juice,
            whipping cream, and salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add a small spoonful of the hot melted butter to the egg mixture and stir well. Repeat this process adding a
            spoonful at a time of hot butter to the egg mixture.( Adding the butter slowly, a spoonful at a time, will
            temper the eggs and ensure they don't curdle).</li>
        <li>Once the butter has been incorporated, pour the mixture back into the saucepan. Cook on low heat, stirring
            constantly, for just 20-30 seconds. Remove from heat and set aside. It will thicken as it cools. Stir well
            and add another splash of cream, if needed, to thin.</li>
        <p>To poach the eggs:</p>
        <li>Fill a medium size pot with about 3 inches of water. Bring the water to a boil and then reduce heat until it
            reaches a simmer. You should see small bubbles coming to the surface but not rolling.</li>
        <li>Add a little splash of vinegar to the water (this is optional, but it helps the egg white to stay together
            once it is in the water).</li>
        <li>Crack one egg into a small cup (I use a measuring cup). Lower the egg into the simmer water, gently easing
            it out of the cup.</li>
        <li>Cook the egg in simmering water for 3-5 minutes, depending on how soft you want your egg yolk. Remove the
            poached egg with a slotted spoon.</li>
        <li>**It is not abnormal for a white foam to form on top of the water when poaching an egg. You can simple skim
            the foam off of the water with a spoon.</li>
        <li>While the egg is cooking, place the slices of Canadian bacon in a large pan and cook on medium-high heat for
            about 1 minute on each side.</li>
        <p>To Assemble:</p>
        <li>Toast the English muffin. Top each toasted side with a slice or two of Canadian bacon, and then a poached
            egg. Top with hollandaise sauce.</li>
    </ol>
